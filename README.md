Comparing multiple machine learning algorithms to perform collaborative filtering. 
The root mean squared error (RMSE) metric was used to report the performance of the different algorithms.

The dataset used is the MovieLens 100K Dataset: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

The implementation contains the following algorithms:
1. Autoencoder
2. Deep autoencoder
3. Singuler value decomposition (SVD)
4. K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
    1. Basic KNN
    2. KNN with mean
